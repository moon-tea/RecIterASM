recIter
====

This has two important functions: one that iteratively adds an array of numbers, and another that recursively adds an array of numbers.
=======
      How to use:
You will see a prompt asking for a list of numbers to be added. This list should be single digit numbers without spaces. For example, the input "12" would output "3" as it would sum both 1 and 2.

Example:
Please a Series of numbers, without spaces, to be added:
3734
Here is what you typed in, added interatively:
17
Here is what you typed in, added recursively:
17
